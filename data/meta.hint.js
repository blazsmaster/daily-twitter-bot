  // EXTRA
  // never use the "files" and "poll" fields at the same time, the "files" field is primary
  // you can leave empty the "files" and the "text" field empty, but always fill at least one, because you can't create empty tweets
  // you can remove the "poll" object
  // search up for maximum lengths and image/video sizes

  // valid examples here
